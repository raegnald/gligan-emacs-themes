#+title: Gligan's Emacs Themes

This is a collection of all the Emacs themes I have created.

https://gligan.net/emacs-themes

** Installation

With Emacs 30 or higher, you can directly pull the files from this
repository:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package gligan-themes
  :vc (:url "https://github.com/raegnald/gligan-emacs-themes"
       :branch "main"))
#+end_src

Otherwise, just clone this repo into your Emacs folder.

** Usage

You can interactively select the theme to apply by doing =M-x
gligan/set-theme=. This function gives you a list of all Gligan themes.
Find the one you like most, and then to load it automatically every
time you open Emacs, add it to your Emacs configuration.

Let's say that you liked the Ellas theme, then you would add:

#+begin_src elisp
(gligan/set-theme 'ellas)
#+end_src

Note that the function =gligan/set-theme= can work with any theme --
even themes that are not part of this collection. Use this function if
you want other functionality of this package to work, like
=gligan/spacious-frame= for instance.
